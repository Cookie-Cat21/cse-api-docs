## Why this exists

Community lists (e.g. [GH0STH4CKER](https://github.com/GH0STH4CKER/Colombo-Stock-Exchange-CSE-API-Documentation)) name endpoints but often skip request shapes, failure modes, and WebSocket. This project:

- Verifies each endpoint with an automated **probe harness** (re-run weekly in CI)
- Stores **truncated samples** + last-verified dates
- Documents **STOMP** at `/api/ws`
- Ships **curl + Python** examples
- States **ethics** up front (rate limits, no auth abuse)

Hosted docs: **<https://cookie-cat21.github.io/cse-api-docs/>**

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cookie-Cat21/cse-api-docs.git
cd cse-api-docs
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Live probe (polite delays; writes samples/ + catalog/last_probe.json)
python3 scripts/probe.py

# Build static site into site/
python3 scripts/build_site.py

# Local preview
python3 -m http.server 8765 --directory site
# open http://127.0.0.1:8765/
```

## Layout

```
catalog/endpoints.yaml   # source of truth
samples/                 # truncated live JSON
scripts/probe.py         # verifier
scripts/build_site.py    # static HTML docs
docs/                    # markdown sources (ethics, websocket, …)
examples/                # curl + python
site/                    # generated (committed; deployed to GitHub Pages)
```

## Python helper package

```bash
cd python
pip install -e .
python smoke.py
```

Thin wrappers only (`market_status`, `company_info`, `trade_summary`, …). Same ethics as the docs.

## CI

- [`probe.yml`](.github/workflows/probe.yml) — weekly (Mon 06:00 UTC) + on push: live-probes every endpoint, uploads the report.
- [`pages.yml`](.github/workflows/pages.yml) — rebuilds the site and deploys it to GitHub Pages on push to `main`.

Born from research for [Chime](https://github.com/Cookie-Cat21/Chime), a Telegram-first alerting layer for the CSE that consumes a subset of these endpoints.
